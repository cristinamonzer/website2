## About Me

I am a Political Communication researcher with the Department of Sociology and Political Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). At NTNU I have been involved in the LEGACIES project, where I georeferenced historical maps of states in Africa and Asia on modern day coordinates. In my PhD work, I focused on developing a theory of cultural resonance that fits within the framing theory universe. Cultural resonance pertains to understanding how individuals react to political and media communication within the context of shared cultural knowledge. I employed a social psychological understanding of values, and a word embedding based methodology, to ask questions related to how political and media value-based references resonate with audiences. Furthermore, I imported knowledge on cross-cultural moral emotions, such as guilt and shame, to test a causal cultural resonance effect of policy support. More broadly, my research interests include framing processes, immigration debates, symbolic- and value-based politics, moral emotions, and the integration of computational social science approaches with semiotic analysis.
