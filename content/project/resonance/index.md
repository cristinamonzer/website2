I've explored the concept of 'cultural resonance' in my PhD work entitled--"Aligning and deviating voices. Toward a theory of political communication". In our recent publication in Human Communication Research, Daniela Dimitrova and I investigated how references to values in news media posts on Facebook speak to cultural journalistic practices and how values resonate differently in Romania and the U.K. Further work stemming from my dissertaton is currently in the publication process.

Until I can provide more updates on ongoing research articles, please see a summary of my PhD dissertation:
Have you ever wondered why some political messages stick while others fall flat? This PhD project dives into the world of ‘cultural resonance’ to uncover how cultural symbols shape our understanding of politics. Imagine scrolling through social media and seeing a politician’s post. What makes you stop and engage? Often, it is a reference that you are familiar with that catches your eye. This is cultural resonance in action.

This study explores how political figures, and the media, use cultural symbols to connect with audiences. These symbols, called ‘cultural carriers’, can be anything from popular sayings to national values. They act like secret handshakes between politicians and the public. But here is the twist: cultural resonance is not just about clever messaging. It is a two-way street. When we see these cultural carriers, we do not just passively absorb them. We actively interpret them based on our cultural knowledge and personal experiences.

The research spans three countries: Germany, Romania, and the UK. Each has its unique cultural landscape, allowing for rich comparisons. By analyzing social media posts and comments, and people’s reactions to an online news article, the dissertation paints a vivid picture of cultural resonance at work. One key finding? Cultural references are everywhere in political communication. But their impact is not always predictable. Sometimes cultural references resonate strongly; other times, they miss the mark.

This unpredictability becomes crucial during global crises. Take the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. The study shows how cultural differences affected how people responded to public health messages. What worked in one country sometimes backfired in another. Understanding cultural resonance is not just academic curiosity. It has real-world implications for how we communicate about important issues. From public health campaigns to election strategies, grasping these cultural nuances can make or break a message. This research opens new doors for exploring how culture shapes our political world. It challenges us to look beyond the surface of political messages and consider the cultural currents beneath.
