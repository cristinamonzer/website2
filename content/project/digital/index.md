As part of my postdoctoral work, I study how social media platforms privilege certain identities in contemporary political debates, developing methodological frameworks to analyze identity markers in multimodal content using computational social science techniques. Her current work focuses on identifying user strategies for self-presentation on TikTok. I am interested in how group identities—such as political identity, nationality, and gender—become visible through societal symbols and values, examining how these elements shape public interpretation of current issues and political participation.
