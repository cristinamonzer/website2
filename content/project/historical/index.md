This work stems from the LEGACIES project at NTNU. With the help of NLP techniques I extract information on historical polities in Africa and Asia between 1750 and 1920. Together with [Christoffer Wold Andersen](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/christoffer.andersen) we investigate the impact of persistent and non-persistent institutions on contemporary political outcomes, as shaped by historical states.
