title: Conceptualizing cultural resonance outcomes in response to moral emotion frames

event: Milan Summer School of Political Communication 2024
event_url: https://polcomm.unimi.it/

location: Milan, Italy

summary: Paper presentation at the Milan Summer School 2024
abstract: In this single-authored article I use data from a three-country cross-national survey experiment to develop a typology of cultural resonance responses to moral emotion frames (i.e., guilt and shame). I utilize large language models (LLMs) to classify respondents' open-ended responses and extract information from the texts, such as their evaluation of the infection control measure, the level of Covid-19-related concerns expressed, the sentiment of their response, and the degree of reasoning in their evaluation. Based on these features, I cluster the responses into types of cultural resonance.
